# My Interview Questions
**Tips before you head in:**
Be prepared to explain what interests you about the role and the team (or teams) you’ll be meeting with.

Be concise but detailed in your answers. A good test is to pause after your answer to ask if you’ve given enough detail or if the interviewer would like you to go into more depth.

We aim to hire smart, thoughtful, customer-obsessed people. “Why Amazon?” is a common question. We want to understand what inspired you to explore an opportunity with us, so we can get a better sense of who you are.

write scalable, robust, and well-tested code
Make sure that you check for edge cases and validate that no bad input can slip through
you should be familiar with broad database concepts and their applications. The more you know about trade-offs between relational and non-relational databases, the better prepared you’ll be.

**Clarifying Questions**
Always ask clarifying questions to ensure you fully understand the problem. For example:

- Input/output format (e.g., "Can the input array be empty?").

- Edge cases (e.g., "What should the output be if the input is invalid?").

- Constraints (e.g., "What’s the expected range of input size?").

**Coding Best Practices**
- Modular Code: Write clean, modular code with helper functions if needed. This shows you can write maintainable code.

- Naming Conventions: Use meaningful variable names (e.g., maxProfit instead of mp).

Edge Cases: Always test for edge cases (e.g., empty input, large input, negative numbers).

**Optimization**
- Start with a brute-force solution if you’re unsure of the optimal approach. Then, optimize step by step.

- Explain your thought process as you optimize (e.g., "This approach has O(n²) time complexity, but we can improve it to O(n) by using a hash map.").
