# My Interview Questions
**Tips before you head in:**
Be prepared to explain what interests you about the role and the team (or teams) you’ll be meeting with.

Be concise but detailed in your answers. A good test is to pause after your answer to ask if you’ve given enough detail or if the interviewer would like you to go into more depth.

We aim to hire smart, thoughtful, customer-obsessed people. “Why Amazon?” is a common question. We want to understand what inspired you to explore an opportunity with us, so we can get a better sense of who you are.

write scalable, robust, and well-tested code
Make sure that you check for edge cases and validate that no bad input can slip through
you should be familiar with broad database concepts and their applications. The more you know about trade-offs between relational and non-relational databases, the better prepared you’ll be.
