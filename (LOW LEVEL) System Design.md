## Approach to Low-Level Design
- Clarify Requirements: Ask questions to understand the scope (e.g., "How many users will the system support?").

- Define Core Classes and Relationships: Identify the main entities and their relationships.

- Write Clean Code: Focus on modularity, readability, and scalability.

- Discuss Trade-offs: Be prepared to explain why you chose a particular design (e.g., "I used a hash map for O(1) lookups.").
