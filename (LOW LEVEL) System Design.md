# (LOW LEVEL) System Design
**todo:** 
- study all sections, then review appraoch & design patterns for solving such problems, then kill it! **

Key Topics:
-
      - OOP Principles: 
			- Encapsulation
			- Inheritance
			- Polymorphism
			- Abstraction
      - Design Patterns: 
		    - Singleton
		    - Factory
		    - Observer
      - Distributed Systems
			- Load Balancing 
			- Caching 
			- Databases
	  - Design Scalable Systems 
			- URL shortener
			- chat system
			- scalable key-value store 
			- monitoring system, track server-side errors in real time
			- distrubuted cache
			- rate limiter
			- web crawler 
      - service-oriented architectures, map-reduce, distributed caching, load balancing, and others
      - memory management, processes, threads, synchronization, paging, and multithreading few basic distributed computing concepts.
      - how browsers function at a high level, from DNS lookups and TCP/IP, to socket connections.

## Approach to Low-Level Design
- Clarify Requirements: Ask questions to understand the scope (e.g., "How many users will the system support?").

- Define Core Classes and Relationships: Identify the main entities and their relationships.

- Write Clean Code: Focus on modularity, readability, and scalability.

- Discuss Trade-offs: Be prepared to explain why you chose a particular design (e.g., "I used a hash map for O(1) lookups.").

### Common Low-Level Design Problems
- Design a Parking Lot
- Design a Library Management System
- Design a Chess Game
- Design a URL Shortener (basic version)
