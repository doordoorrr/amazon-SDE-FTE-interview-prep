# Time/Space Complexity Review

Common Time Complexities
--

 - O(1): Constant time (e.g., accessing an array element).
 - O(log n): Logarithmic time (e.g., binary search).
 - O(n): Linear time (e.g., iterating through an array).
 - O(n log n): Linearithmic time (e.g., merge sort).
 - O(n²): Quadratic time (e.g., nested loops).
 - O(2ⁿ): Exponential time (e.g., recursive Fibonacci).
