# Amazon Interview SDE FTE Review and Notes
## Round Structure
**Before Coding:** Ask clarifying questions before jumping in to code the problem. Voice your assumptions – this will help the interviewer steer you back on track if needed. Ask for examples and use them to validate your ideas.

**During Coding:** Explain your decision making. Describe your code. Write syntactically correct real code vs. pseudocode. Try to be consistent in your naming conventions and it will make testing/optimizing easier later. If you forget a specific API or specific link into an array, etc., you’re welcome to ask the interviewer who should be able to help you.

**After Coding:** Test your code and talk through optimizing the solution if it can be further optimized if there is more time. Most important here is that you should focus on having a working and fully coded solution on the board to the problem by the end of each interview. If it’s easier for you to start with an inefficient brute force approach and then optimize from there at the end, it’s a perfectly valid approach. Just state that up front with your interviewer. Brute force solution is better than an incomplete solution.

1. Tech/LP
    Focus on **medium leetcode** problems. Be ready to explain your thought process and optimize your solution.

    *"I was asked two DSA problems in this round; This was followed by two Leadership Principles (LP) questions. This was 30 min LP + 30 min coding(1 LC medium)"*

2. Tech/LP
    Similar to Round 1, but may involve **more complex problems or follow-up questions**. Practice problems involving trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.

    *"Started with two LP questions, followed by a matrix-based DSA problem. Expectation: Write optimal, modular code and handle follow-up questions."*

3. BAR RAIIIISERRR
    Be prepared to discuss your **past projects and how they align with Amazon’s principles**. If system design is included, practice designing basic systems (e.g., a parking lot system, a URL shortener, FACEBOOK which is questionable in an amazon interview... u get the point).

    *"This round focused entirely on Leadership Principles (LP). I was asked several behavioral questions and was expected to answer using the STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result). The interviewer did a lot of cross-questioning to evaluate my problem-solving and decision-making skills."*


*"Just understand the design patterns and go through some common questions. Try and think what patterns you can apply. Implement one or two to understand how much time you will take..in this round you don't have to write all the getter setters and the boilerplate code. You can just tell it to the interviewer that you are gonna skip it to save time. And practicing one or two questions will help you in getting an idea of how much time you need to spend on writing code and which code you should skip. Best of luck"*
