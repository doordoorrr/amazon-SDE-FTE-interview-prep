# Amazon Interview SDE FTE Review and Notes

## Round Structure
1. Tech/LP
    "I was asked two DSA problems in this round; This was followed by two Leadership Principles (LP) questions. This was 30 min LP + 30 min coding(1 LC medium)"
2. Tech/LP
    "Started with two LP questions, followed by a matrix-based DSA problem. Expectation: Write optimal, modular code and handle follow-up questions."
3. BAR RAIIIISERRR
    "This round focused entirely on Leadership Principles (LP). I was asked several behavioral questions and was expected to answer using the STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result). The interviewer did a lot of cross-questioning to evaluate my problem-solving and decision-making skills."


*"Just understand the design patterns and go through some common questions. Try and think what patterns you can apply. Implement one or two to understand how much time you will take..in this round you don't have to write all the getter setters and the boilerplate code. You can just tell it to the interviewer that you are gonna skip it to save time. And practicing one or two questions will help you in getting an idea of how much time you need to spend on writing code and which code you should skip. Best of luck"*
