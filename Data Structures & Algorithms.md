You should also know some of the languages’ nuances, such as how memory management works, or the most commonly used collections, libraries, etc.

You’ll be expected to know the runtimes for common operations as well as how they use memory.

Consider reviewing common algorithms such as traversals, divide and conquer, breadth-first search vs. depth-first search and understand the trade-offs for each.

Knowing the runtimes, theoretical limitations, and basic implementation strategies of different classes of algorithms is more important than memorizing the specific details of any given algorithm.




given a problem definition, you should be able to formulate it as a machine learning problem and propose a solution, including ideas for data sources, annotation, modeling approaches, and potential pitfalls. Understand the basic AI/ML methods and algorithms. Revisit your favorite ML and AI textbooks.
