# **Data Structures & Algorithms**

 Key Topics:
-
	- Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
	- Trees (Binary Trees, BST, Tries)
	- Graphs (BFS, DFS, Shortest Path)
	- Hash tables, Heaps
	- Sorting and Search Algorithms 
	- Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Backtracking
	- Vectors

You should also know some of the languages’ nuances, such as how memory management works, or the most commonly used collections, libraries, etc.

You’ll be expected to know the runtimes for common operations as well as how they use memory.

Consider reviewing common algorithms such as traversals, divide and conquer, breadth-first search vs. depth-first search and understand the trade-offs for each.

Knowing the runtimes, theoretical limitations, and basic implementation strategies of different classes of algorithms is more important than memorizing the specific details of any given algorithm.

you should be familiar with broad database concepts and their applications. The more you know about trade-offs between relational and non-relational databases, the better prepared you’ll be.

few basic distributed computing concepts.

as service-oriented architectures, map-reduce, distributed caching, load balancing, and others, will help you formulate answers to some of the more complicated distributed architecture questions you might encounter.

topics that can affect code performance (e.g. memory management, processes, threads, synchronization, paging, and multithreading).

how browsers function at a high level, from DNS lookups and TCP/IP, to socket connections.

given a problem definition, you should be able to formulate it as a machine learning problem and propose a solution, including ideas for data sources, annotation, modeling approaches, and potential pitfalls. Understand the basic AI/ML methods and algorithms. Revisit your favorite ML and AI textbooks.
